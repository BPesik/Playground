## Welcome to my playground

The initial goal of this project is to create a platform where we can experiment with different takes on how we achieve our goals. As a software developer we have so many options to achieve conceptually the same thing. For this reason this project should be considered as a platform where we can keep on adding new ways to essentially achieve the same thing.
